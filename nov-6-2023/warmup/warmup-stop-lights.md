# Monday November 6, 2023 Warmup

-----------------------------------

Create a React page displaying an intersection with stop lights. 

There will be a stop light with 3 circles on the top of the page. 
There will be a stop light with 3 circles on the left of the page. 

Each stoplight will have borders in the circle.
1- First circle border is red
2- Second circle border is yellow
3- Third circle border is green

The middle of the circle will be transparent when the stop light isn't 'using' that color for our imaginary traffic. 
When the circle is being 'used' have the circle be filled with the corresponding color. 

The initial state of the stoplights is Red for both stoplights. 
The stoplights will cycle like stoplights in an intersection. 
The first stoplight at the top will go Red, then Green, then Yellow. Then Red. 
After the first stoplight has cycled the second stoplight (the stoplight on the left) will cycle, Red, then Green, then Yellow, then Red. 

After the second stoplight has cycled then the first stoplight will cycle again.
